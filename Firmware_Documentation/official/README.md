# Testing checklist

* ~Validate CAN tranmission using my dual CAN driver~

* ~Validate PWM and ADC DMA + voltage conversions~

* ~Validate fan frequency and rpm logic~

* ~Validate Bosch pressure + temp sensor logic~

* Validate MIP and A1325 pressure and temp sensor logic

* Validate power consumption input data reads

* Integration test with receiving sensor inputs along with sending messages over CAN bus

* Integration test with receiving sensor inputs to use on control driver with GPIO outputs and PWM outputs

* (Officially) flash the ACC board using NUCLEO board/ST-LINK for final integration test
