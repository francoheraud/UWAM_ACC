# UWAM Accumulator Cooling Control
## Brief Overview
The ACC is a board that takes in data from temperature and pressure sensors, and adjusts the cooling fans of the accumulator when the LV system is on. ACC functionality must include:

* Receiving additional segment temperature sensor data from the AMS via CAN.

* Must be able to log all sensor data (i.e. fan RPM, temperatures, pressure values) and power consumption and send it out on the CAN bus.

* Must develop a closed-loop control system that robustly controls the fan speed based off sensor inputs.
